CHANGE LOG : GREENSOCK TWEENING PLATFORM
----------------------------------------

2012-05-10
----------------------------------------------
TweenLite		beta 5.3
TweenMax		beta 5.3
	- Added static "ticker" property to TweenLite and TweenMax to make it easier to access rather than going through "Animation" class. 

2012-05-01
----------------------------------------------
TimelineMax		beta 5.2
TweenLite		beta 5.2
TweenMax		beta 5.2
	- Added set() method to TweenMax and TweenLite
	- Added getLabelsArray() method to TimelineMax

2012-04-10
----------------------------------------------
	- Changed TweenLite and TweenMax's behavior so that if their duration and delay are both 0, they will default to immediateRender:true.

2012-04-02
----------------------------------------------
TweenLite		beta 5.1
TweenMax		beta 5.1
TweenNano		beta 5.1
Ease			beta 1.1
SlowMo			beta 1.1
	- Added a new "endcapMode" parameter to SlowMo ease to make it much easier to sync things like alpha tweens or blur tweens with positional SlowMo tweens (see ASDocs for details)

2012-03-27
----------------------------------------------
TweenLite, TweenMax, TimelineLite, TimelineMax beta 5
	- Fixed issue that could cause a zero-duration tween not to render correctly if it was at the very beginning or end of a TimelineMax that repeats.

2012-03-23
----------------------------------------------
[all classes]
	- Changed goto() to seek() because "goto" is a reserved keyword in Javascript (for future versions). 
	- Changed name of OutIn ease to SlowMo to make it more intuitive/memorable.
	- Added Power0, Power1, Power2, Power3, and Power4 eases which are identical to their less intuitively named Linear, Quad, Cubic, Quart, and Quint/Strong counterparts.
	- Removed some redundant eases like QuadIn, QuadOut, QuadInOut, CubicIn, CubicOut, CubicInOut, etc. because it seemed wiser to keep the standard way of referencing eases like Quad.easeIn rather than QuadIn.ease. 
	- Changed some property names of the Ease class which were for internal use.

2012-03-08
----------------------------------------------
TweenLite			beta 4.1
	- Fixed issue that could cause a zero-duration tween to incorrectly overwrite a tween that starts at exactly the same time in a nested TimelineLite/Max (of the same object). Rare, but possible. 

2012-02-24
----------------------------------------------
TweenLite			beta 4
TimelineLite			beta 4
Animation			beta 4
	- Fixed issue that caused a from() tween that is initially paused not to render immediately
	- Added ability to self-reference the tween/timeline in the onCompleteParams, onUpdateParams, onStartParams, onReverseCompleteParams, and onRepeatParams array using "{self}". 

2012-02-23
----------------------------------------------
TimelineLite			beta 1.2
TweenPlugin			beta 3
[many plugins were updated too]
	- Added an extra "baseTimeOrLabel" parameter to all of the timeline convenience methods (see ASDocs for details)
	- Added a _roundProps() method and removed the _round property from TweenPlugin to improve the handling of rounding.

2012-02-21
----------------------------------------------
TimelineLite			beta 1.1
	- Changed the parameters of the TimelineLite.exportRoot() so that you can pass in extra special properties like onUpdate, onComplete, etc. See the ASDocs for details.
